I have built an application, where users can effortlessly share
their experiences, thoughts, and reflections through engaging blog posts. Additionally,
users will have the chance to draft a CV that summarizes their blog entries, providing
the recruiter with a useful overview of their character, experiences, etc.
This capstone project aims to revolutionize the application process, creating a win-win
situation for both job seekers and recruiters. Combining the power of blogging with
resume creation encourages a forum for genuine self-expression and a more
comprehensive assessment of talent.
